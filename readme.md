##### Engine / Core

Global player options control play, pause and volume.

Volumes 60, 65 and 30, 35 are good volumes to listen. And 25 is a good volume for listening to music on low volume.

User's saved volume templates.

Choose from Kelvin's saved volume templates.

I recommend working with earphones and macOs system level 12 and lower.

Note: the rain on tin roof is super similar to the heavy hitting of rain I experienced at Gibraltar, UK (south of Spain) where the weather climate is hot. I also experienced 30+ degree celcius weather in my travel during Gibraltar's winter period. Gibraltar has had two referendums on staying in the UK and Gibraltar have voted twice 99% to remain in the UK.
