# Kelvin Kamara

(05-Apr-2023) Soundscape, background noise app. To focus on your task and entertainment. I recommend earphone use.

- We can do it and it's not just do it.

- What are they tryna tell you?

- Erm...

I recommend accompanying the Kelvin Kamara sound app with lofi hip-hop beats to relax and study to (e.g. [lofi hip-hop live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk)). I enjoy listening to deep house music with vocals, with the Kelvin Kamara sound app. I'm a fan of [Monstercat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm36k08jQ0M) pre-2017. After 2016 I stopped keeping up with Monstercat. I listen to Monstercat pre-2017.

## Misc

I also just search `progressive house music live` on Youtube to accompany the sound app. At time of writing I am listening to different genres like hip-hop, celebrating the release of [Nodejs CRM add admin favicon](https://github.com/kkamara/nodejs-crm).

I wear sunglasses (I mostly keep them on the top of my head rather than on my nose) and [face mask](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08FK54H5Q) (I mostly keep that under my chin). I will remove my tonsils ASAP.
